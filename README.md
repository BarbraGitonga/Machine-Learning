# Machine Learning
This is group of Jupyter notebook that contain different projects wwhile i learn.

## Linear Regression
 - This is a folder that contains a linear regression task that aims to predict the value of a house in California.
 - The housing.csv is the dataset used for both training and testing.
 - The dataset is split so that 60 percent is used for training, 20 percent for testing and 20 percent for validation.
 - The housing.ipnyb file is the Jupyter notebook. I have tried explaining what is happening in each cell for ease of following up. It also uses the updated scikit learn library hence the functions and libraries used are valid.
 
 ## Classification
 - This folder contains classification problems from tutorials i take to challenges on Kaggle.
 Titanic is a challenge from Kaggle
